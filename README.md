# Andrew-Ng-Notes

This repository contains my personal notes from **Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Specialization** (Coursera).  
The notes are organized by course and modules, and include key concepts, formulas, and explanations that helped me understand and revise ML fundamentals.

These PDFs include summaries of:
- Linear & Logistic Regression  
- Gradient Descent  
- Regularization  
- Neural Networks  
- Evaluation methods  
- Bias–Variance  
- And more

## Repository Structure

The repository includes PDFs exported from my OneNote notebook, organized by course modules:

### Course 1 — Supervised Machine Learning: Regression & Classification
- **Course 1 Module 1.pdf** — Introduction to ML, supervised learning, datasets  
- **Course 1 Module 2.pdf** — Linear regression, cost function, gradient descent  
- **Course 1 Module 3.pdf** — Logistic regression, classification, decision boundaries  

---

### Course 2 — Advanced Learning Algorithms
- **Course 2 Module 1.pdf** — Neural networks, activation functions, forward propagation  
- **Course 2 Module 2.pdf** — Training neural networks, backpropagation  
- **Course 2 Module 3.pdf** — Regularization, bias & variance, hyperparameters

## Purpose of This Repo
- To keep all my ML notes organized in one place  
- To revise ML concepts quickly during interviews  
- To prepare for IEEE AIML club work & projects  
- To document my learning journey through the ML specialization
